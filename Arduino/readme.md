# Arduino projects

Here are some Arduino projects, that I have been working on. This repository holds my parts of some collaboration projects that were made for my University.

## Main frame

The main frame of an Arduino project is: 

**Unreal Engine** to have a game scene, 
**Arduino board** is used to alter the gaming experience, 
**Plugin** is something that Unreal Engine uses, and in these projects they are primarly data transfer -plugins.

## Programming

Programming is made in Unreal Engine using its virtual scripting method **Blueprints**, screenshots are included in the projects. For Arduino the code is written in Arduino IDE using Arduino programming language **Processing** which syntax is similar to Java language.
